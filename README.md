# StackCell

*StackCell* is an esoteric programming language which consists of two stacks of integers and some commands to manipulate it. You also get a single cell which can be written to and read from as much as you like.

The interpreter can either take a filename as an argument, or programs can be entered into an interactive interface.

Recommended file extension: `.cel`

## The stack

The stack is a list of unsigned bytes. The stack is initially empty, and attempting to read elements from an empty stack will give a zero.

## The Cell

The cell contains a single unsigned byte. Initially it contains the value 0, but can be written to to overwrite its value. When it is read from, its value is not cleared.

## Examples

### Hello world!

`#0A"!dlrow olleH":[;:].`

This program prints `Hello world!` to the console.

| Instruction      | Description                                                                                                                  | Stack             | Output |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| `#0A`            | Pushes a newline (`0x0A`) to the stack                                                                                       | `\n`              |
| `"!dlrow olleH"` | Pushes the string "Hello world!" to the stack, in reverse order                                                              | `Hello world!\n`  |
| `:`              | Duplicate the top value of the stack (`0x48`) so that there is still a copy on the stack after the `[`                       | `HHello world!\n` |
| `[`              | Begin the print loop, consuming the top value of the stack (`0x48` during the first iteration)                               | `Hello world!\n`  |
| `;`              | Consume the top value of the stack (`0x48` during the first iteration) and output it as ASCII                                | `ello world!\n`   | `H`    |
| `:`              | Duplicate the top value of the stack (`0x65`) so that there is still a copy on the stack after the `[` of the next iteration | `eello world!\n`  | `H`    |
| `]`              | Return to the beginning of the loop and repeat                                                                               | `eello world!\n`  | `H`    |

### Reverse input

``(@:#0A-)`:[;:]#0A;.``

This program reads a line of input from the user, and prints it in reverse.

- `(`: Begins the input loop
- `@`: Reads a character from the keyboard and pushes it onto the stack
- `:`: Duplicates the top inputted character to allow for comparison
- `#0A`: Pushes a newline (`0x0A`) to the stack
- `-`: Subtracts the top two values of the stack (it doesn't matter which way round, as the result is either zero or non-zero)
- `)`: Returns to the beginning of the loop, if the last character wasn't a newline.
- `` ` ``: Discard the newline at the end of the user's input
- `:[;:]`: Print the stack, as before. This will print the user's string, but in reverse
- `#0A;.`: Print the trailing newline, then stop

### Truth machine

`'0@-:[:'0+;:]'0+;.`

As per [the esolang page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Truth-machine), this program accepts an input of 1 or 0, and then exhibits one of two behaviours:

- If the input is 1, it prints 1 repeatedly, forever
- If the input is 0, it prints 0 once, then exits

<!-- -->

- `'0`: Pushes an ASCII `'0'` to the stack
- `@`: Reads a character and pushes it onto the stack (`'0'` or `'1'`)
- `-`: Subtract the `'0'` we pushed before from the `'0'` or `'1'` we just read (this gives us a numeral result of `0` or `1`, respectively)
- `:`: Duplicate the top value of the stack (`0` or `1`) so that there is still a copy on the stack after the `[`
- `[`: Begin the loop, consuming the top value of the stack (`0` or `1`)
- `:`: Duplicate the top value (`1`) of the stack, so that there is still a copy on the stack after transforming and printing it
- `'0+`: Add an ASCII `'0'` to the top value of the stack (`1`) to get the ASCII `'1'`
- `;:]`: Print the top value of the stack (`'1'`) and return to the beginning of the loop
- `'0+;.`: Transform the `0` back to `'0'` and print it, then stop

### Quine

I was unable to write a quine. Probably just due to me being bad at that. I got close a couple of times and added more language features (such as cell storage and jumps) but I couldn't make it work. If you manage to write a quine, please submit a pull request!
