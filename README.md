# StackCell

*StackCell* is an esoteric programming language that consists of two stacks of integers and some commands to manipulate them. You also get a single cell which can be written to and read from as much as you like.

*StackCell* is turing complete: `bf_to_cel.py` can compile any program written in [the turing tarpit BF](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) into *StackCell*.

The interpreter can either take a filename as an argument, or programs can be entered into an interactive interface.

Recommended file extension: `.cel`

## The stack

The stack is a list of (wrapping) unsigned bytes. The stack is initially empty, and attempting to read elements from an empty stack will give a zero.

## The Cell

The cell contains a single (wrapping) unsigned byte. Initially, it contains the value 0, but can be written to to overwrite its value. When it is read from, its value is not cleared.
